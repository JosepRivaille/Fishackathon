# FishTheRule - Fishackathon CÃ¡diz 2018

## What is your solution?
"Fish the Rule" is an application that geolocates the user in the land or the sea and gives the information related to the fishing regulations that could affect them depending on the type of ship, the ubication and the date.

## What impact will it have?
Every day fishers around the world break maritime laws for many reasons, some for lack of knowledge of them. We want to make more accessible and simple to accomplish the maritime regulations (constantly changing) to all areas (European, national and regional).

## How did you build it?
We developed an android application that connects with a backend server implemented with Atlas mongodb (a mongodb in the cloud) and express. The backend is hosted in the heroku cloud platform. Also augmented reality is used in the mobile application.
